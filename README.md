## üö© Identified Phishing Indicators

**1.Spoofed Sender Address**
- The email claims to be from Banco Bradesco, but uses a suspicious domain:  
  `@atendimento.com.br` instead of a legitimate `@bradesco.com.br`.
  
**2.Suspicious Links**
- The main action button uses a link:  
  `https://blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra.me/`  
  which is **not a Bradesco domain** and is likely used for credential harvesting or malware.

**3.Urgent Language**
- The message pressures the user with:  
  ‚Äú92.990 pontos LIVELO expirando HOJE‚Äù (points expiring **today**), a classic urgency tactic.

 **4.Grammar and Spelling Issues**
- There are awkward phrases such as:
  - "Descontos de ate 35%" (missing accent in "at√©")
  - "Troque seus pontos por milhas aereas" (should be "a√©reas")

**5.Fake Branding and Styling**
- Although the email mimics Bradesco‚Äôs branding, it includes:
  - Missing or fake image references (e.g., `header.png`)
  - Suspicious HTML with non-standard fonts and links

**6.Social Engineering**
- Exploits desire to avoid losing reward points, luring users into clicking harmful links.

## üö© Red Flags Identified in Phishing Email ample.txt
**Suspicious Sender Address**
- **From**: banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br
- **Why it's suspicious**: A legitimate Bradesco email would likely use an official domain like @bradesco.com.br, not a generic or misleading domain like atendimento.com.br (which means "support" in Portuguese ‚Äî easily abused).
